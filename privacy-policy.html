    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: January 2025</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Just Spices (“we,” “our,” or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy
        explains how information is handled when you use the Just Spices mobile app.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        Just Spices does <strong>not</strong> require account creation and does
        <strong>not</strong> collect personal identifying information such as your name,
        address, phone number, or payment details.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app may store pantry-related data locally on your device (such as your
        spice inventory) for functionality purposes only.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
<h2>3. Data Import &amp; Export</h2>
<p>
  The app includes optional import and export features that allow you to transfer your data between devices or storage locations. These features are entirely user-initiated and user-controlled.
</p>
<p><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You can use all import and export functions without creating an account.</p>
<p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> You may choose to store your data locally on your device. In this case, all data remains on the device and is not transmitted to any external server controlled by us.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud or External Storage:</strong> If you choose to export or import data using a third-party storage or cloud service (such as iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar), the handling of that data is governed by that service’s own privacy policy, not ours. The app does not access or store your cloud login information.</p>
<p><strong>What We Collect:</strong> The app does not collect, transmit, or store any user data related to your import/export actions on our own servers. All transfers occur directly between you and the chosen storage location.</p>
<p><strong>User Control:</strong> You choose if, when, and where your data is exported. You may delete exported files at any time using your device’s file manager or your chosen cloud provider’s tools. Imported files are processed locally on your device and are not sent to our servers.</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Because import and export actions are user-directed and processed locally or through your chosen storage provider, the protection of your data partly depends on the security of your device and any third-party services you use. We recommend enabling device-level protections (such as passcodes or biometric locks) and securing any cloud accounts used for data storage.</p>
</div>
    <div class="card">
      <h2>4. Barcode Scanning</h2>
      <p>
        When you scan a barcode, Just Spices uses third-party product databases to
        identify the item. Barcode data may be transmitted temporarily to retrieve
        matching product information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not sell, rent, or personally identify users through barcode scans.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>5. Data Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Any pantry data stored in the app is used solely to provide the app’s
        features, such as tracking your spices and preventing duplicate purchases.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell, trade, or share your personal data with third
        parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect your data. However, no method of
        electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        Just Spices is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
        reflected on this page with a new effective date.
      </p>
